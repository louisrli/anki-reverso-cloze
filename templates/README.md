These are suggested templates for use with the created cards, although you can
definitely adjust or add your own cards as you wish.

1. Create a **cloze** note type with any of the fields that are used in the template.
2. Create a card type with the front and back contained in the given files.
3. Adjust any links in `back.html` that might be language specific.

For how to create note or card types, you'll have to check the Anki
documentation or poke around the UI yourself.
